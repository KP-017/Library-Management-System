# Library-Management-System
To create a Library Management System

Our project aims to create a simple Database Application that will be used to manage the library of a college or a school which can be accessed with the help of a GUI. This Application will provide us with the efficiency to look over the books issued, to check them,monitor them and manage the Library.

The Library Management System  gives us the ability to check on our available books, add Librarians, manage them, edit them and more if necessary. The system performs all of these functions by executing queries like ADD, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE IF NOT EXISTS,etc.
